# SwiftLlamaApp

This is a sample app built on the llama.cpp project.

https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp

As llama.cpp is a Swift package, this app simply depends on the llama.cpp, and utilizes its API.

Put llama gguf model in the SwiftLlamaApp/Resources downloaded from the next link. I tried [llama-2-13b.Q4_0.gguf](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GGUF/blob/main/llama-2-13b.Q4_0.gguf) and it worked greatly.
